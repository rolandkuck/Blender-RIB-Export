blender-rib-export allows you to export your Blender scene to the RIB file 
format. This can then be used to render the image via a Renderman-compatible 
renderer.

To install, copy the 'blender-rib-export.py' file and 'ribexport/' folder into 
your blender script directory. Go to the script view in blender and selected 
'Export to RIB' from the 'Render' menu.
