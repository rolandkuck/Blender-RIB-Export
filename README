blender-rib-export allows you to export your Blender scene to the RIB file 
format. This can then be used to render the image via a Renderman-compatible 
renderer.

There currently does not exist a real GUI for the exporter. To export your 
scene, copy the 'rib.py' and 'params.py' files into your blender script 
directory, open 'export.py' in the Blender text editor and press Alt-P to run 
the script.  The output file is at the moment always called 'output.rib'.
